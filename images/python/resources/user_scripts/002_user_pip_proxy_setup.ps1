# Which in turn is configured to whitelist the hosts specified in our properties.json5 file.
# Configuring Python to use a proxy is as simple as creating a `pip.ini` file which is read by
# Python on startup.
# If you do NOT want to allow for the installation of external Python packages you can remove this file
# from the final build
